The blog has landed!

I'm currently working as a Cyber security apprentice. 

On the job I'm on defense, off the job I practice offense by doing far too many CTFs.

This blog will include whatever I find interesting, like writeups for CTFs and random stuff.

Disclaimer: Do not use any information 
obtained from this blog maliciously, be cool.
