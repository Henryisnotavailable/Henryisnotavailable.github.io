## What's the purpose of this blog?


I'm starting this blog to give me an excuse to research into new things, understand them, and maybe even explain them... 

This is also a way to test my knowledge, and document what I've been up to.

---

### Topics I'll probably cover

- Writeups for CTFs (mostly HTB)
- Exploit writing and analysis
- Malware development and detection
- Defense evasion 
- General Security Stuff
- Complicated stuff that I need to write down to fully understand (looking at you Kerberos)
