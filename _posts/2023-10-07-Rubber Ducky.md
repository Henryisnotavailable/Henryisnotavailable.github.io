# Make your own rubber ducky

If you don't know, a rubber ducky is essentially a pre-programmed USB keyboard that types at a super fast speed. Oh, it also looks like a harmless flash drive ;)


You can find the official rubber ducky from the Hak5 [website](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky). At a price of ~$80 it's not cheap...

Thankfully you can make your own for ~$2.50! All it requires is 
- An [Attiny85](https://www.amazon.co.uk/attiny85/s?k=attiny85)
- Some [drivers]()
- The [Arduino IDE]()
- A Windows OS (I haven't tested on Linux)
